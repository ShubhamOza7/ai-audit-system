# Setting up a GitHub Repository

Follow these steps to push your code to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub at https://github.com/new

   - Name: ai-audit-system
   - Description: A comprehensive system for auditing AI models for fairness, explainability, and regulatory compliance
   - Choose public or private based on your preference
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license since we already have those

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub:

   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/ShubhamOza7/ai-audit-system.git
   ```

3. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

After these steps, the repository will be available at https://github.com/ShubhamOza7/ai-audit-system

## Sharing with Others

Once your repository is on GitHub, others can clone it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamOza7/ai-audit-system.git
cd ai-audit-system
```

They should then follow the setup instructions in the README.md file to install dependencies and run the system.
